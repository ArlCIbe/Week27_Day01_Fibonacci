# Week27_Day01_Fibonacci

Create a repo.

In it, implement the Fibonacci Sequence 2 times. Once, via loops and again via recursion. Do this in either a single .js file or a C# Console Application.

In your repo's readme, describe:

* The Fibonacci Sequence

* The difference in the loop and recursion model

* The Big O Notation for this algorithm and how you arrive at that conclusion
